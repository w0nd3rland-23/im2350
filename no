        <h3 id="q1"> 1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
        
            <p>The top carousel banner on the Homepage was the first this I paid attention to during my experience on the NGV website. The colours were what got my attention first, due to a majority of the site being in a black and white theme. </p>
        
        <h3 id="q2">2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
        
            <ul >
                <li>I am scrolling down on the Homepage</li>
                <li>Clicking on the Melbourne Now exhibition page on the home page </li>
                <li>Watching the video in the banner, reading the information about how many artists and works are in the exhibition</li>
                <li>Clicking on the map in top right corner</li>
                <li>Clicking back</li>
                <li>Clicking Home</li>
                <li>Traditional owners acknowledgement </li>
                <li>Clicking on "Collection" in the main home bar </li>
                <li>I'm scrolling down on the Collection page </li>
                <li>Clicking on the "Environment" theme in Collection</li>
                <li>Scrolling on Environment</li>
                <li>Clicking "What's On" in the main navigation bar</li>
                <li>Scrolling</li>
                <li>Starting to watch virtual tour</li>

            </ul>

        <h3 id="q3"> 3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </h3>

            <p>The Melbourne Now exhibition page was where I spent the most time, with the video being very engaging along with the map feature. </p>
        
        <h3 id="q4"> 4. What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
           
            <p>The most common action I had in my 2 minute experience was scrolling through pages. There was a large emphasis on content to be scrolled down on, clicking on content that you would like more information on, such as the Collections page and the What's On page. </p>
            
        <h3 id="q5"> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
          
            <p> My impression of the primary goal of this interactive experience was promotion and information provided on the activities, exhibitions and news occurring around the NGV. It appeared professional and clean, conveying the prestige and reputation of the NGV as an important gallery in the Australian arts sector.</p> 
        
        <h3 id="q6"> 6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
        
            <p>The NGV site communicates this primary goal through pages about the events going on, the home page providing information about different locations and exhibitions, as well as the opening hours of the gallery. The design of the website also contributes to achieving this goal in the minimalism of the colours and shapes used in its layouts, appearing modern and minimalistic. The minimalistic design also allows for artwork images on the different pages to stand out more. </p>
        
        <h3 id="q7"> 7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
        
            <p>The impression I received from the website about how it should be interacted with over time was for brief periods of time 3-7 minutes to find information about upcoming events and exhibitions, when an upcoming visit to the gallery is planned. Different articles and further information on pages such as the collection however also indicated that for those doing more in-depth research into the gallery, more time could be spent on the website engaging with the articles and interactive activities such as virtual tours. </p>
    
        <h3 id="q8"> 8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
            
            <p>It indicates that the website is a useful resource for upcoming visits to the NGV, however, features such as the virtual tours show that the website also caters to those who may not be visiting the gallery, or live internationally, allowing for research and engagement with the gallery despite not being able to visit. </p>

    <h1 style="background-color: #02433c;">Week 3 Questions</h1> 

        <h3 id="q9"> 9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>

            <p> Media forms that the NGV replicates include digital forms such as online news with their article sections with the channel section and online shopping sites with their own shop page. The layout of the website, with its emphasis on enclosed boxes and spacing has similarities to physical books and catalogues in the art space, such as the layout of Art Guide editions, catalogues for exhibitions and other publications offered by galleries. </p>

        <h3 id="q10">10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

            <p>These references communicate that the website is only intending to be a part of the experience. With items such as Art Guides or catalogues, they are intended to be used to guide and inform people about exhibitions and galleries that they can then engage with. The NGV site reflects this in its emphasis of the exhibitions it has in its physical spaces, with brief information about these spaces, encouraging people to visit the actual location. The website therefore conveys an idea that it is meant to be treated as a companion to engage with, to enhance the experience of the events and exhibitions held at NGV locations.</p>

        <h3 id="q11">11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        
            <p>These references communicate that while engaging with the experience, you should feel intrigued and excited by the offerings of the gallery, prompting a visit to the location. You should feel that the site is easy to navigate to find more information about certain events, however, you aren't immediately overwhelmed with huge paragraphs, rather basic information needed to plan a trip to the NGV. </p>

        <h3 id="q12">12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>

            <p> The most frustrating part of the interaction in my experience was some features being inefficient and confusing in accessing information. For example,  the “What's On - Events” search feature lists a huge number of different filters, which I found difficult to navigate. </p>
            
            <p>Below is an example of the filters on the What's On Page:</p>
            
            <img src="img/whats.on.jpg" width="100%" height="40%" alt="NGV Whats On Page Screenshot">
        
        <h3 id="q13">13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>

            <p>The most satisfying part of the interaction for me was being able to find more information if I wanted to. The layers in the site allowed me to get an overview of the offerings at the gallery but rewarded further exploration with engaging features like maps and virtual tours. This made engaging with the site rewarding, encouraging me to further interact with its features. </p>
